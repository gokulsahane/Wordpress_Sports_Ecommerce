Calculated Fields Form allows you to create both simple and rich forms, quickly like a professional. It includes a form builder with dynamic calculated fields and many other controls.

== Description ==

The "Calculated Fields Form" plugin allows you to create web forms with calculated fields, whose values are dynamically calculated based on other fields' values in the web form.

The possibilities are unlimited. You can create forms with financial calculations, date operations to create reservation forms, calculate the products' prices. The plugin includes text operations for editing, translation, or advertising services. There are available more advanced operations such as determining the distance between addresses or generating graphs. The resulting forms are 100% mobile responsive.

And the most impressive thing is that you don't need to hire a programmer to create the forms. With basic knowledges, you will have a professional form in just five minutes.

Creating a form is all visual. The "Calculated Fields Form" plugin includes a form editor with multiple controls. Text fields, numeric fields, currency fields, slider controls, email fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, container fields, page breaks to create multipage forms, etc., and most importantly, calculated fields.

The form editor includes the list of controls, the property bar to edit field properties easily, the dashboard where you can design your forms, and the attributes for form configuration. Also, the plugin comes with multiple predefined layouts to change the forms' appearances. And if the predefined layouts are not enough for your project, there is a style editor to customize the form's design.

The "Calculated Fields Form" plugin includes integration with popular page builders:

* Classic WordPress Editor.
* Gutenberg Editor.
* Elementor.
* Page Builder by SiteOrigin.
* Beaver Builder.
* WPBakery Page Builder.
* DIVI Builder.

For other editors, it is possible to insert the form into the pages via its shortcode. Each web form has a shortcode associated that allows you to insert it wherever you want.

== Other Notes ==


This section mainly contains notes on features of the form builder that are too long to explain in the main description.

= Conditional rules =

It is possible to show or hide form fields (dependent fields) based on the options ticked in checkbox fields, radio buttons, the options selected in dropdown menus, or the result of calculated fields.

The value of a dependent field is zero when it is hidden/disabled. The plugin excludes from submission the disabled form fields.

[Additional details about the use of dependencies](https://cff.dwbooster.com/blog/2020/03/01/dependencies/ "Description about the use of dependencies")

= Predefined values =

The predefined values in the fields have two possible uses:

1- To fill the field by default. That makes it easier for the end-user to enter values.

2- Hint of the values to be entered in the field (like "enter your name"). To use the predefined value as a placeholder, you must tick the checkbox "Hide predefined value on click" The value will disappear once the user starts filling in the field. The calculated fields ignore placeholders from the equations.

= The "User Instructions" attributes =

The "User instructions" attribute in the field settings allows you to instruct the user on fill in the field. By default, the instructions appear as a smaller text on the public website. But they can be configured as tooltips.

= Adding CSS layout keywords =

The "Add CSS layout keywords" attribute in the fields settings allows you to apply CSS styles to fields. You must enter only the name of the CSS classes names and not their definitions.

You can define the CSS classes via the "Customize Form Design" attribute in the "Form Settings" tab. This attribute contains a CSS editor with syntax highlighting and error checking.

If you want to assign several class names to the field, separate them by space characters.

The plugin includes multiple predefined classes that you can assign to the form fields.

More information about the form's design, by reading the following post in the plugin's blog:

[Customizing the form's design](https://cff.dwbooster.com/blog/2020/01/12/form-design/ "Customizing the form's design")

The classes listed below allow you to align two, three, or four fields on the same line:

    column2
    column3
    column4

For example, if you want to put two fields on the same line, give both fields the class name "column2".

There are other variants for displaying several fields on the same line, such as container fields (Div or Fieldset). Container fields allow you to select the number of columns in your configuration. The following post describes all the alternatives for positioning the fields in the form:

[Formatting the form (distributing the fields in columns)](https://cff.dwbooster.com/blog/2019/01/06/columns/ "Formatting the form (distributing the fields in columns)")

= Multi-page form =

To create multi-pages forms, you must insert "Page break" controls between fields belonging to different pages.

When the user presses the "Next Page" button, the plugin validates the fields in the current form. If there is any validation error (such as an unfilled required field), the plugin stops the "Next page" action.

= Hidden calculated fields =

Calculated fields include a checkbox in their configuration that allows to hide them from the public website. This feature is essential in those fields that we will use to calculate intermediate values or when we want to show the results only in emails or thank you pages.

= Equations / formulas format for calculated fields =

Below, I will include some possible formulas as examples, but the possibilities are endless.

* With simple mathematical operations:

    `fieldname1 + fieldname2`

    `fieldname1 * fieldname2`

    `fieldname1 / fieldname2`

    `fieldname1 - fieldname2`

    `fieldname1 - fieldname2`

* With mathematical operations involving multiple fields and grouped fields:

    `fieldname1 * (fieldname2 + fieldname3)`

* With rounding operations. Round the result to two decimal places:

    `PREC(fieldname2 / fieldname3, 2)`

* There is an infinity of formulas that require complex structures. For example, the following formula includes conditional statements:

    `(function () {`
    `if (100 < fieldname3) return fieldname1 + fieldname2;`
    `if (fieldname3 <= 100) return fieldname1 * fieldname2;`
    `})();`

* For complex formulas/equations you must use the function format with return statement to return the result to the calculated field:

     `(function () {`
        `var result = 0;`
        `/* Your code here */`
        `return result;`
    `}) ();`

= Operations and operators to use in equations/formulas =

One of the "Calculated Fields Form" strengths is to use any valid javascript code to implement the equations/formulas.

However, the plugin includes a wide variety of operations and operators to simplify the development process.

[Mathematical Operations and Operators](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#mathematical-module)

[Conditional operations](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#conditions-module)

[Field Handling Operations](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#managing-fields-module)

[Operations for interacting with external services](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#connection-module)

[Operations for handling URLs and query strings](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#url-module)

In addition to the operations modules listed above, the Developer and Platinum versions of the plugin include additional modules:

[Date and time operations](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#datetime-module)

[Financial Operations](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#financial-module)

[Distance and Travel Time Operations](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#distance-module)

[Operations to generate charts](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#chart-module)

= Controls available in the form generator of the "Calculated Fields Form" =

The complete list of controls is available at the link: [CLICK HERE](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#common-fields)

= Create JavaScript variables to use in the equations from parameters received by "GET" or "POST", "SESSION" variables, or "COOKIES" =

The plugin includes the shortcode [CP_CALCULATED_FIELDS_VAR] to generate javascript variables from parameters received by "GET" or "POST",  "SESSION" variables, or "COOKIES":

`[CP_CALCULATED_FIELDS_VAR name="..."]`

In the shortcode, you must replace the "..." symbols with the name of the parameter or variable. It will be the same name for the javascript variable.

For example:

`[CP_CALCULATED_FIELDS_VAR name="varname"]`

You can use the variables generated through the shortcode [CP_CALCULATED_FIELDS_VAR] in the formulas of the calculated fields: `fieldname1*varname`

The complete list of parameters accepted by the variables shortcode is available at the following link: [CLICK HERE](http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#javascript-variables)

= Tips for calculating prices =

One of the most frequent uses of our plugin is for price calculation. When displaying the prices of a good, you may want to split the form into two pages. The first page would request the information needed to calculate the price, and the second page would include the calculated field with the final price. Also, you could use the "Instruct. Text" fields to indicate the terms, conditions, and validity time of the offer.

Note that you can make the "Instruct. Text" fields dependent on the calculated value. That allows you to vary the text displayed to the user depending on the calculated price. As often, the terms, conditions, or offers depend on the amount of the transaction.

		getField(123).setVal(5);
